#### Lorem Ipsum consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- **Input** box which takes the number of paragraphs for generating the **dummy/placeholder text** by clicking the `GENERATE` button along with the page title *TIRED OF BORING LOREM IPSUM?*.
- Functionality is 
   - By default when the application loads, the input will be 1 and there will be no paragraphs. 
   - if the input is between 1 to 9, it generates the required paragraphs.
   - If the input is changed less than 1 i.e., 0, negative numbers, and click generate will display an error message "Value must be greater than or equal to 1."
   - If the input is given greater than 9, an error message is displayed "Value must be less than or equal to 9."
- Data is handled by the `data.js` and styles are handled by `index.css`
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
